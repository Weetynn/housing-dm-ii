# Data Pre-processing, Feature Engineering, and Hypothesis Testing for King County Housing Data

## 📚 Introduction

An extension of the work done in [Part I](https://github.com/Weetynn/housingdata-dm-i.git), detailing the data preparation steps for further analysis of the King County housing dataset. Includes data pre-processing, feature engineering, and the testing of five key hypotheses to explore how attributes namely square footage, bedrooms, house age, lot utilization, and view ratings influence house prices.

    ▪️ The literature review examines key factors influencing real estate prices, focusing on both internal and external factors.
    
    ▪️ Internal factors include structural features of the property, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, total square footage, condition, and age of the property.
    
    ▪️ External factors include location, proximity to amenities like schools and public transport, and neighborhood characteristics such as population density and social status.
    
    ▪️ Previous studies are referenced to highlight how housing attributes affect property prices.
    
    ▪️ The findings from the literature are used as benchmarks for validating the hypothesis testing results in this report.
